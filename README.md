Functional components of the project
Following is a list of functionalities of the system. More functionality that you find appropriate can be added to this list. And, in places where the description of functionality is not adequate, you can make appropriate assumptions and proceed.
Existing Airline information is already stored in the database. Any new passenger information can be stored in the database via a passenger information input screen. The screen will take as input all the details of the passenger along with his name, the whole address he belongs from, the journey details also the Identity proof details like Pan Card number etc.

The Airline data entry operator should be able to:
•	Login to the system through the first page of the application. 
•	Change the password after logging into the system.
•	Enter / edit the Airlines details if one is not available or late for some time.
•	Keep the track of number of seats occupied in Airline and the journey distance or also the way of travelling i.e. Domestic or international.
•	View information of all passenger details, their amount to be paid based on the reservation booked and the number of seats selected.
•	Update the table fields (passenger details, the amount to be paid, number of seats seat number, the reservation number, etc.) as soon as a new passenger is being entered into the system.
